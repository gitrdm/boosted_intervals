This package includes a set of short discipline-focused vignettes that show typical use-cases for interval arithmetic with units. The files below are rendered into HTML (and are available under `inst/doc/` after rendering):

- [Physics — uncertainties](physics-uncertainties.html)
- [Mechanical engineering — tolerancing](mechanical-engineering-tolerancing.html)
- [Geoscience — uncertainty propagation](geoscience-uncertainty.html)
- [Finance — interval cashflows and user-defined currency units](finance-intervals.html)
- [Pharmacokinetics — dosage intervals and clearance](pharmacokinetics.html)
- [Fermi estimation — pizza box coverage with intervals](fermi-pizza.html)

Each vignette is short and self-contained. If you'd like, I can add lightweight plots or small example datasets to any of them.
